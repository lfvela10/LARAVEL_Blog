# LARAVEL_Blog
A blog built in Laravel, the php framework. I followed the guidance of Jeffrey Way from Laracasts. 

This is my first project in either php and laravel. 

This blog connects to a local sql based database. It registers and authenticates users. It saves blogs accordion to the user and shield others projects from being seen or altered by anyone other than the user.
